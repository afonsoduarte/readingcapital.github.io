The result of the fetish subchapter was that while people collectively bring
about the social relations of commodity production and exchange, they are not
aware of this, they do not do this consciously. Rather, their social relations
appear to them as relations of things and they relate to these objective
forms. Hence, Marx picks up on the commodity owners and their intends only now
to determine them as character masks of their commodities.

Commodities were determined as means of exchange in chapter 1. These means of
exchange do not exist in a society where production is first of all for
self-sufficiency and where only the surplus product is exchanged. Instead, the
capitalist mode of production prevails and material wealth generally takes the
commodity form.

The character of commodities as means of exchange is not determined by the
particular commodity with which they are exchanged. Commodities have the purpose
to be in principle exchangeable for any other commodity on the market.

This presupposes, in a first step, a separation of need and use-values, i.e. the
means to satisfy this need. Presupposed is *private property* as a social
principle.  Everybody may dispose over his/her property at will, i.e. everybody
else is excluded from that property. The value of a commodity is a way to get
access to those things which I am reliant on but which are private property of
somebody else.

Private property in the hand of others is a barrier which needs be overcome. On
the other hand, my own private property is the lever by which I can get access
to somebody else's private property. Before one can demand property from
someone, that someone must be excluded from the means of satisfaction of his/her
needs — through private property. My commodity's body is the leverage by which I
can attract the interest of other members of society, such that I can demand
something in return from them. For that, every use-value is equally good as long
as there is some demand for it in society. Attracting those goods which I am
actually interested in is accomplished by exploiting the neediness of others, a
neediness which is established by private property.[^1]

So when we talk about "means of exchange", "exchangeability as property of the
commodity" we should say more precisely: commodities have the purpose of being
access resources to social wealth; means of access to that material wealth from
which one is excluded by private property. Use-value is subordinated under this
determination. In a society based on commodity production and exchange somebody
being hungry is no reason to feed that somebody. This principle explains in an
abstract way already why in this society immense collections of use-values
coexist with poverty.

For this commodity owners have to relate to each other in a particular
way. First of all, they must respect each other as respective owners of their
commodities. Being an owner means to have exclusive right of disposal over one's
own property. By relating to each other as commodity owners, they relate to each
other as *persons*: they abstractly acknowledge the other's will. That is, they
acknowledge that the other party's will applies to their property and cannot be
broken.  However, since their respective motives imply that they relate to each
other with opposed interests, a contract becomes necessary. In the contract the
initial will is relativised and transformed into a common will to which both
parties hold each other. Hence, the concrete will of the other party is not as
such respected. Put differently, the acknowledgement of the abstract will is the
condition for pursuing interests which deny the concrete will of the other.

> 179:1 What chiefly distinguishes a commodity from its owner is the fact that
> every other commodity counts for it only as the form of appearance of its own
> value. (…) The owner makes up for this lack in the commodity of a sense of the
> concrete, physical body of the other commodity, by his own five and more
> senses. For the owner, his commodity possesses no direct use-value. Otherwise,
> he would not bring it to market. It has use-value for others; but for himself
> its only direct use-value is as a bearer of exchange-value, and consequently,
> a means of exchange. He therefore makes up his mind to sell it in return for
> commodities whose use-value is of service to him. All commodities are
> non-use-values for their owners, and use-values for their non-owners.

On the one hand, a commodity owner Alice wants to use her own commodity to get
her hands on the things she desires. Hence, her particular need/desire is
decisive for the relation to her opposite commodity owner Bob. On the other
hand, she does not want to become impoverished through the transaction, she
wants to realise the value of her commodity. The practical standpoint of each
commodity owner is to relate to her own commodity as universal equivalent. This
way, there is no universal equivalent and the commodities only confront each
other as products.

The commodity owners can only realise their interests as commodity owners if
they are externally presented with a commodity which immediately is value. Only
this way they can relate their commodities as commodities. Money hence is also
derived from the demands of commodity owners. On the other hand, the same as in
the value-form analysis applies. A commodity can only be money because all
commodity owners relate to it as such. It remains the collective deed of
commodity owners to make money money. But they do not do this self-consciously.
