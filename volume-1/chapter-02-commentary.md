> Commodities cannot themselves go to market and perform exchanges in their own

The result of the fetish subchapter was that while people collectively bring
about the social relations of commodity production and exchange, they are not
aware of this, they do not do this consciously. Rather, their social relations
appear to them as relations of things and they relate to these objective
forms. Hence, Marx picks up on the commodity owners and their intends only now
to determine them as character masks of their commodities.

> In order that these objects may enter into relation with each other as
> commodities, their guardians must place themselves in relation to one another
> as persons whose will resides in those objects, and must behave in such a way
> that each does not appropriate the commodity of the other, and alienate his
> own, except through an act to which both parties consent. The guardians must
> therefore recognize each other as owners of private property. (178)

To relate to each other via their commodities – this is after all what the
persons are interested in – commodity owners have to relate to each other in a
particular way. Firstly, they must acknowledge each other as respective owners
of their commodities. Being an owner means to have exclusive right of disposal
over one's own property. By relating to each other as commodity owners, they
relate to each other as persons: they abstractly acknowledge the other's
will. That is, they acknowledge that the other party's will applies to their
property and cannot be broken.  However, since their respective motives imply
that they relate to each other with opposed interests, a contract becomes
necessary. In the contract the initial will is relativised and transformed into
a common will on which both parties bind each other. Hence, the concrete will of
the other party is not per se honoured. Put differently, the acknowledgement of
the abstract will is the condition for pursuing interests which deny the
concrete will of the other.

> What chiefly distinguishes a commodity from its owner is the fact that every
> other commodity counts for it only as the form of appearance of its own
> value. (…) The owner makes up for this lack in the commodity of a sense of the
> concrete, physical body of the other commodity, by his own five and more
> senses. For the owner, his commodity possesses no direct use-value. Otherwise,
> he would not bring it to market. It has use-value for others; but for himself
> its only direct use-value is as a bearer of exchange-value, and consequently,
> a means of exchange. He therefore makes up his mind to sell it in return for
> commodities whose use-value is of service to him. All commodities are
> non-use-values for their owners, and use-values for their non-owners. (179)

On the one hand, a commodity owner Alice wants to use her own commodity to get
her hands on the things she desires. Hence, her particular need/desire is
decisive for the relation to her opposite commodity owner Bob. On the other
hand, she does not want to become impoverished through the transaction, she
wants to realise the value of her commodity. The practical standpoint of each
commodity owner is to relate to her own commodity as universal equivalent. This
way, there is no universal equivalent and the commodities only confront each
other as products.

The commodity owners can only realise their interests as commodity owners if
they are externally presented with a commodity which immediately is value. Only
this way they can relate their commodities as commodities. Money hence is also
derived from the demands of commodity owners. On the other hand, the same as in
the value-form analysis applies. A commodity can only be money because all
commodity owners relate to it as such. It remains the collective deed of
commodity owners to make money money. But they do not do this self-consciously.
