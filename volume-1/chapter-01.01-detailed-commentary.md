> appears as its elementary form.

Marx starts with what “appears”, something taken from observation.  However, how
something appears does not *necessarily* match how it *is*, it's jut how that
what is appears. Just because the wealth appears as a collection of commodities
does not mean that commodities are the wealth of societies in which the
capitalist mode production prevails. Marx project is to start from the simple
observation and to proceed to the explanation.[^1]

In his first sentence, Marx defines the object of his analysis. He studies the
wealth of societies in which the capitalist mode of production prevails. One
might argue that actually the wealth of societies presents itself as the GDP or
as debt or as money or … .  However, here the starting point is much more
simple: people need to eat, shelter etc. – that is the material wealth they need
in any society. Which form does it take here? Commodity form!

So, he studies the *properties of wealth* in *this* society. This is different
from how economists usually proceeds. Modern economics, in contrast, starts from
scarcity not wealth: “Economics is the study of the use of scarce resources
which have alternative uses.”[^2] The fundamental claim of current bourgeois –
i.e. neoclassical – economics is scarcity. Marx on the other hand insists that
something particular is happening if on the one hand people can produce enough
stuff that other people who don't produce stuff can eat and on the other hand
people go hungry. This points to a social particularity not to scarcity in
general.

Finally, in this first sentence Marx clarifies that the object of this book is
not what many people associate with Marxism: a philosophy of history as such. In
this work, the object is the wealth of societies in which the capitalist mode of
production prevails. Nothing more but also nothing less. Also, the first three
chapters which deal with simple commodity circulation are not meant as an
idealistic picture of how society could be or has been – but as an account of
*this* society.  Hence, in this book Marx starts much more limited than both
bourgeois economics and what people believe to be Marxism: he studies the
commodity.

> Our investigation therefore begins with the analysis of the commodity.

His investigation does not start with value, but with the commodity.  Marx is
famous for arguing a labour-theory of value, but that is not his
object. However, the statement about the elementary form of wealth implies that
Marx attempts a systematic development of political economy in capitalism.

> The commodity is, first of all,[^3] an external object, a
> thing which through its qualities satisfies human needs of whatever kind. The
> nature of these needs, whether they arise, for example, from the stomach, or
> the imagination, makes no difference.  Nor does it matter here how the thing
> satisfies man’s need, whether directly as a means of subsistence, i.e. an
> object of consumption, or indirectly as a means of production.

By wealth he thus – following his predecessors[^4] – means
*material wealth:* *stuff* that is useful to us. Commodity here ought to be
understood as *something which is produced for sale or exchange.* So for now
services such as accounting are not covered, it's a fun discussion to be had to
think about various services such as hair cutting whether they belong here or
not. We will have to content ourselves with knowing that we need stuff to live
and how this stuff is produced in this society, that's what Marx starts from:
how does the bread arrive at the person who eats it? Whether this then also
explains what goes on in accounting remains to be seen.

Neither for the market nor for the scientific investigation does it matter why
someone wants something, important is – for now – only that she wants that
thing. This also implies that a society in which commodities are produced and
exchanged a certain level of abundance must have been achieved. If the
production of food is the foremost question being subject to some whim of
someone does not seem like viable strategy. This economy is not dominated by
nature but there is freedom to decide what to produce for which purpose. For
comparison: perhaps an investigation into the economy of Egypt at the time of
the Pharaohs might have started like this: "The economy must always be based on
the semi-annual periods of flooding of the Nile."

> two points of view of quality and quantity.

A particular thing satisfies a particular need, not any need: quality.  If I'm
hungry I want bread not chairs. From this perspective things are very much not
interchangeable, they are of different qualities.

“Usefulness” is an expression of a relation between someone's desire or need and
the physical properties of some external object. Discovering applications for
things is the work of history, e.g. that magnets can point us to true north.

So also is the invention of socially recognized standards of measurement for the
quantities of these useful objects. The diversity of the measure for commodities
arises in the from the diverse nature of the objects to be measured, and in part
from convention.

According to the quality of a certain thing, we count it in a particular way,
e.g., we don't count chairs in weight usually but simply number them when we are
concerned with their usefulness for sitting on them.  Even how we quantify
different things differs between them.

A thing is useful because of its physical properties: the relation between me
and the thing requires specific properties in the thing.  Things must be organic
to be digestible for example, it might take history to discover that certain
mushrooms are edible – or have other creative effects – but it is their physical
properties which allows to discover this. Separated from humans, taken on its
own, usefulness reduces to physical properties[^5]: “Use-value as an aspect of
the commodity coincides with the physical palpable existence of the commodity.“
(Contribution) All possible uses have the physical properties in common: “One
and the same use-value can be used in various ways. But the extent of its
possible application is limited by its existence as an object with distinct
properties.” (Contribution)

A piece of wood I found on the street is as useful as a piece of wood for which
I had to chop a tree. In that regard more work does not necessarily mean more
material wealth. When productivity for coats increases, and hence making a coat
takes less time, it still keeps you warm the same. Use-value is a category of
consumption, not production.

> quantities, such as dozens of watches, yards of linen, or tons of iron.

To realise the qualities of use-values a certain quantity is necessary: With one
grain of wheat I cannot eat my fill. For a two person household usually one
fridge is sufficient, four are usually too many for this purpose. To make use of
a certain quality it needs to be available in a certain quantity. One brick is
not enough to build a house, 1 billion is too much. One grain of rice is too
little for a meal, 100g perhaps about adequate. Put differently, to build a
house one does not want bricks, many bricks or more bricks. One wants however
many bricks it takes to build a house: a definite quantity.

## Excursus scarcity vs. greed: ##

Scarcity is a category of relation: there is not enough coffee at this seminar
for all of us to drink coffee to stay awake. It is a relation of how much stuff
there is vs. how much someone wants *for some purpose*. In modern economics
stuff is scarce regardless of the need that confronts it. Of course, there are
things of which there is only a limited supply. But of many things more can be
produced – it is a bit ironic that economics disregards production when they
start their political economy of production and consumption. For example, Thomas
Sowell explains scarcity using beach-front homes, i.e., something which is
limited by its location. Also, if there just is not enough of something, no
clever approach in the world can make this situation go away, no economy can
solve that there is only one original Mona Lisa painting. Consequently when they
start with scarcity the don't continue by writing a list of stuff that is
missing, in order to fix this shortcoming. They need scarcity as such as the
first category of their economics. When they argue this image they completely
disregard production: they argue for a particular solution – i.e., the
capitalist mode of production – to solve a problem which disregards
production. Excursus end.

Being a use-value is no particularity of the capitalist mode production.  Thus,
when we investigate the particularities of this mode of production, the
use-value side or usefulness is not where we'll be successful. This does not
mean however that use-values will play no role later during the
investigation. It just doesn't make commodities specific to this society.

Why does he write: “Use-values are only realised in use or in consumption”? To
emphasise that in exchange they are not realised.

> In the form of society to be considered here they are also the material
> bearers of … exchange-value.

In all societies people need to eat and in all possible social organisations
people need to work to produce the stuff to consume. This cannot change. What
can change on the other hand is the social form in which consumption is related
to production. One such form is the market which makes exchange-value a
particular social quality of wealth in societies in which the capitalist mode of
production prevails.

Capital is known to be a rather strict book. Concepts or categories are derived
from each other in such a way that the transition is necessary and there is
considerable debate among Marxist scholars about “transition problems” from
e.g., commodities to money (end of this chapter) and money to capital (chapter
three to four). Here, however, there is no such transition. One cannot derive
exchange-value from use-value, use-values exist without being
exchange-values. Instead, their relationship is in this society is simply
stated: use-values are degraded to bear exchange-value.

> Exchange-value appears first of all as the quantitative relation, the
> proportion, in which use-value of one kind exchange for use-values of another
> kind.

For now, exchange-value appears as a relation between *two* use-values.  If one
can get two chairs for a metric ton of apples, then two chairs are the
exchange-value of one metric ton of apples. By “one kind” is expressed that
the next metric ton of apples also gets one two chairs – if the apples are of
the same kind. Exchange-value is not a property of a particular batch of apples,
but every metric ton of apples has this property. With “relation” is expressed
that e.g., two metric tons grant access to four chairs. This might seem self
evident but it is not: one could say, for example, we want everybody to be able
to get chairs, so as you buy more and more chairs they become more and more
expensive (measured in apples) or, alternatively, one cannot even buy more than
two chairs, full stop. This is clearly not how this society exchanges.

If one takes exchange-value as a property of the commodity (an assumption which
will be corrected in the following) then apples are determined as “means to
access chairs” or “chair access resources” (both of which are ways to say
“Zugriffsmittel” in English). While the use-value of apples is their quality to
appease hunger, their exchange-value – as far as we have determined it so far –
as a property of apples is to get access to chairs with them.

> This relation changes constantly with time and place. Hence exchange-value
> that is inseparably connected with the commodity, inherent in it, seems a
> contradiction in terms.

A year ago one metric ton of applies might have allowed to get three chairs. In
Northern England this might still be the case, while in London one only gets
two. In one street apples might exchange for different quantities of
chairs. Perhaps even the same apple owner negotiates different 'chair prices'
for her apples with different people. In light of these variations one could,
when asking how come that apples have the power to access chairs, conclude that
this was indeed not a potential of the apples. One could say as Butler in
footnote 7: “The value of a thing Is just as much as it will bring.” This way,
the explanation of commodities as means of exchange would cease before it really
started: all random. Or one says that it is not random but essentially
determined by the appreciation of the persons involved in the trade. Then
exchange-value would depend on the various needs and desires of people and it
would wrong to say that every apple has the same exchange-value. One would have
to say: every apple has all kinds of different exchange-values, depending on who
has the apple. One also couldn't talk about relations: if one metric ton of
apples gets one two chairs, this would not mean that two tons result in four
chairs. To claim that the exchange-value was grounded in the apple being an
apple independent of the subjective appreciation by the exchangers, that would
be the position of an “objective theory of value”. The latter standpoint would
be that of the “subjective theory of value”, which makes up the modern
mainstream in economics. It considers the objective theory of value to be absurd
by the arguments listed above. However, these arguments deserve critique:

> for example, is exchanged for $x$ boot-polish, $y$ silk or $z$ gold, etc. In

A commodity does not only exchange for one particular other commodity, but for
many. That means it does not only have one exchange-value but many, in various
relations. The apple is not only a “chair access resource” or has not only
“power of access to chairs” but also a boot-polish access resource, a silk
access resource etc. “Many exchange values” here means: apples are access
resources to *all* other use-values in this society, if those are available on
the market.

This “content distinguishable from it” is hence the 'exchangeability as such'
as a property of the apple. Who owns apples can therewith access all material
wealth that is available as a commodity in this society. How far this access
reaches is only a question of how many apples one has. Apples have the
characteristic that they are access resources to social wealth/means of access
to social wealth in a capitalist economy.

That one can use apples to access chairs is then only an expression of the more
general quality of apples to access anything. Apples do not have chairs as
exchange-value because apples are access resources to chairs, but because they
are abstract social access resources or represent power of access sans
phrase. All those different exchange-values express this same quality.

Relative to those arguments above against the objective theory of value, one
hence can say: while the definite proportions and quantities might change, what
remains is the quality of apples to access chairs. And not only that. The
relations between apples and other commodities might change as well, but what
remains is the quality of apples to be exchangeable for them. Quantitatively a
lot might change, but the quality of the apple to become anything else in
exchange remains.

Why the exchange-values fluctuate remains to be explained. If they change longer
term this must be related to the fundamental property of being exchangeable. If
apples exchange for different amounts of chairs at the same time, then this must
be related to the difference between “content” and “appearance”. Here too it
remains to be discussed how that explains those fluctuations.

If a metric ton of apples gives access to two chairs, then it is also true that
two chairs allow one to get one metric ton of applies. All those arguments from
above hence also apply to chairs. Chairs are not only exchangeable for apples,
because they are apple access resources but because they generally have the
quality of exchangeability. Chairs too represent power of access or they are
access resources to the wealth in this society. If chairs then exchange for
applies, then this only expresses that chairs, apples, etc. have the quality to
have abstract exchangeability. This is the qualitative equality, the third thing
that all commodities have in common. This founds their ability to enter a
relation of exchange. This common third things must have a quantitative
dimension, such that when two chairs are exchanged for one metric ton of apples,
then because their abstract social power of access to chairs and apples has an
equal magnitude.

Exchange-values may change with time and space. However, that commodities are
exchangeable is a constantly assumed property of the commodity. Exchange-values
only express this common content. A commodity hence not only has many
exchange-values but also one value (“a content distinguishable from it”). What
is true for one commodity also applies to those commodities which exchange for
it.

The question now is: how is this value formed? However, before we get to that
the follow excursus might be helpful to (a) answer this question and to (b)
understand why a mode of production where material wealth takes the form of
commodities deserves critique.

## Excursus: What is the relation of value and use-value? ##

Commodities are means of exchange. But we are not talking about a society where
production is first of all for self-sufficiency and where only the surplus
product is exchanged. In the capitalist mode of production, which is the object
of our investigation, material wealth almost exclusively takes the form of
commodity. Use-values are determined as bearers of value in this society.

Furthermore, the character of commodities of being means of exchange is not
determined by the particular commodity with which they are
exchanged. Commodities have the purpose to be in principle exchangeable for any
other commodity on the market (that it needs to be available in a certain
quantity is necessary but secondary for this purpose). The statements
presuppose, in a first step, a separation of need/desire and
use-values. Presupposed is private property as a social principle.  Everybody
may dispose over his/her property at will, i.e., everybody else is excluded from
that property. The value of a commodity is a way to get access to those things
which one is reliant on but which are private property of somebody else. Private
property is, on the one hand, a barrier which needs be overcome. On the other
hand, private property is the lever by which one can get access to somebody
else's private property. Before one can demand property from someone, that
someone must be excluded from the means of satisfaction of his/her needs first –
through private property. The use-value of one's commodity is the leverage by
which one can attract the interest of other members of society, such that one
can demand something in return from them. For that, every use-value is equally
good as long as there is some demand for it in society. Attracting those goods
which one is actually interested in is accomplished by exploiting the neediness
of others which is established by private property.[^6]

So when we talk about "means of exchange“, “exchangeability as property of
the commodity” we should say more precisely: commodities have the purpose of
being access resources to social wealth – social power of access. Means of
access to that material wealth from which one is excluded by private
property. Use-value is subordinated under this determination. Just because
somebody is hungry is in a society based on commodity production and exchange no
reason that this somebody gets to eat. This principle explains in an abstract
way already why in this society immense collections of use-values coexist with
poverty. Excursus end.

If we look at the exchange-value side of the commodity their particular
qualities do not matter, given the right quantity they are all the same.
Exchange-value is not only a disregard of a particular quality of commodities,
exchange-value expresses the disregard of any quality of the use-value:
“precisely by its abstraction”. Hence, the only difference they are capable of
as exchange-values is that of magnitude.  The key word here is "differ".

We are looking for a common basis which would ground the capability of
commodities to access social wealth in the hands of others. From the above it
should be clear that this search is not one of the kind: what kind of things can
I think of that they might have in common. If that was the case, we could arrive
at the conclusion that all things have a mass or have something to do with
particles or so. Yet, this does not explain their quality to give access to
social wealth, and that's what we are after.

Every commodity needs a use-value. Only when there is need in society for a
thing, it may be used to attract the interest if other members of
society. However, the usefulness of a thing cannot be quantified. If I want to
study Capital with five people and for that want to have a table with enough
space to take notes and enough chairs to sit five people, then I need a table
with that area and five chairs. Four chairs do not satisfy this need, six chairs
do offer more usefulness for this purpose than five. The standpoint “at least I
have three chairs, then only two people need to sit on the floor” is an
expression of managing scarcity and not an expression that five chairs satisfy a
need better than three.  Five satisfy my need, three don't. Furthermore, if we
compare the usefulness of different use-values then the statement that a bicycle
would be more useful than lunch is pretty absurd. If I am hungry a bicycle does
not help, if I want to get from A to B lunch is of no help.

However, for many people these alternatives, comparisions and quantifications
appear as rather straight-forward. They think about their day-to-day life and
there such questions appear quite often … due one's limited spending power: do I
treat myself to a good meal and don't go to the pub or vice versa? However, when
asking this question one already compares the value of one's money with the
value of the two things one would enjoy doing and comes to the conclusion that
the magnitudes of value do not match up and hence one has to limit oneself.  One
doesn't say that the use-values of money, a decent meal and an evening in the
pub are not the same. Only after one compared the respective values one arrives
at limiting one's needs and desired. And only now one makes the absurd but
forced upon oneself comparison: what can I do without. This way the daily
struggle with value appears as if the exchange relations were determined by
use-values or one's own individual needs and desires.

Two comparisons between use-values are sensible, but have nothing to do with the
question considered here: Firstly, I can compare a use-value in relation to a
particular need. If I want to drink a hot drink, a cup might be more useful than
a glass. A bicycle, however, certainly does not come to mind. Secondly, I can
ask myself whether remodelling my room is worth the effort if it takes up so
much time and energy that afterwards I don't have time to enjoy my remodelled
room. The effort puts the benefit so much in question that I rather not have the
benefit.

From the perspective of the commodity seller, usefulness is definitely not what
founds exchangeability. She does not want to use the commodity but exchange
it. For her it does not have any usefulness at all. The owners of the BMW
company may want drive, say, 10 cars themselves, the remain thousands of cars
which are produced every day are certainly not useful to them. For those who
want to have a BMW it too cannot be irrelevant how many apples they have to give
up in exchange for a BMW.  One could say, well those apples don't have use-value
for them, so it does not matter how many they have to give up, they gets what
they really want. Because access to use-values in this society is dependent on
how much value I own, use-value only plays the part that it must exist in
exchange; the exchangers confront each other on the value-side.  Because
everybody does it, an individual decision also does not play a big role. I have
to take other exchange relations into account and take part. By taking part I
contribute myself that others too cannot act accordingly to their individual
preferences.

That the particular use-values are not the point when we are considering the
exchange-value side of commodities can perhaps be illustrated by the fact that
any use-value - if there is demand for it in society - enables one to exchange
it for all other things in society if one has the right of ownership over these
use-values. Producing gold, fertilisers or toilets, all these things do not
differ qualitatively what wealth one can get access to. If I have enough, I can
exchange them for what I need/want/desire. In fact, when I exchange my
commodities for others, I do not care about their use-value at all. I might be
tea total but beer still has exchange-value (for me), it allows me access to,
say, tea by exchanging it in my pub.

> If then we disregard the use-value of commodities, only one property remains,
> that of being products of labour.

One way to explain this to emphasis that we are looking for a "social" property
when trying to discover what enables commodities to be exchanged. After all they
are only exchangeable in this society. This reading is supported by a passage
from the 1st edition of Capital: "Commodities as objects of use or good are
corporeally different things. Their reality as values forms, on the other hand,
their unity.  This unity does not arise out of nature but out of society. The
common social substance which merely manifests itself differently in different
use-values, is – labour." (1st Edition)

However, this argument is not very convincing and Marx was right removing this
comment from the 4th edition. This argument relies on a double meaning of
social: when we talk of labour, we talk about purposeful interaction with
nature, something we – possibly with others (socially), possibly alone – do with
nature. It is social in the broadest sense: we has human being do it. But this
"social"is a different "social" that is meant when we talk about this particular
society and the social relations we have with each other, i.e., when we talk
about how we confront each other. Hence, Ion its own this statement is not
convincing. If anything, one can make sense of it if we think about "social"
this way: If there is a division of labour, then, "social" also has the meaning
that we don't produce individually but as a society: one party makes cheese one
party makes wine, both consume both wine and cheese. So social is understood as
how we are dependent on each other's products.

Put differently, whatever I buy must be produced first and so does my commodity
which I give up in exchange. I don't need all these arguments Marx made so far
to understand that stuff needs to be produced to be exchanged. This reading is
somewhat supported by a letter that Marx wrote to his buddy Kugelmann where he
ridicules the complaint that he didn't proof the labour theory of value:

"The chatter about the need to prove the concept of value arises only from
complete ignorance both of the subject under discussion and of the method of
science. Every child knows that any nation that stopped working, not for a year,
but let us say, just for a few weeks, would perish. And every child knows, too,
that the amounts of products corresponding to the differing amounts of needs
demand differing and quantitatively determined amounts of society’s aggregate
labour. It is self-evident that this necessity of the distribution of social
labour in specific proportions is certainly not abolished by the specific form
of social production; it can only change its form of manifestation. Natural laws
cannot be abolished at all. The only thing that can change, under historically
differing conditions, is the form in which those laws assert themselves. And the
form in which this proportional distribution of labour asserts itself in a state
of society in which the interconnection of social labour expresses itself as the
private exchange of the individual products of labour, is precisely the exchange
value of these products."[^7]

Recall, that we have a society where there is a division of labour and hence a
mutual dependence on each other. However, in this society - "where the
capitalist mode of production prevails" - this labour is done in private: we
are objectively dependent on each others products of labour, but we insist on
our exclusive right to dispose over them by the virtue of private property.

However, just because there is a guarantee of private property, doesn't mean
there is stuff. Stuff must be produced and those things which fall from the sky
(such as air) cannot be sold (we can simply take them). A chair has the quality
of getting me access to social wealth because it does not fall from the sky. So
that value has something to do with labour, is in itself not such a big
surprise.

There are many which are not products of labour which still can be
exchanged. What about those? Virgin soil is one example. Marx deals with virgin
soil and how the value of it is determined in Volume 3. For now, we can only
say: this is insofar an exception as for the things we need to live, things
which require no labour at all, are the exception.[^8] Marx
will pick this up again briefly at the end of this sub-chapter.

Commodities are produced. This rejects another consideration of modern
economics. It claims that besides the subjective appreciation also its scarcity
would determine its value. A common example for this relation is that in a
dessert a glass of water would have an entirely different meaning than in modern
London. In a desert somebody would give everything for a glass of
water. Firstly, this nicely expresses the blackmail character of exchange, the
owner of water would demand everything from a thirsty person – satisfaction of
needs as purpose, my ass.

Secondly, we want to explain the capitalist mode of production with its immense
collection of commodities on the market and not a single exchange relation in a
dessert where there is no market. Under capitalism no need is not fulfilled just
because something is scarce. If one owns enough value one can fly to space. If
someone earns enough value then that someone can earn as many planes as he
wants. If there is value to be made, then a lot of labour is performed, if not
nothing happens at all. Things are not simply scarce under capitalist, they are
simply not produced for those who cannot offer an equivalent in value.

Anyway, value is apparently somewhat related to labour.[^9] How?

By producing a chair, a use-value, carpentering is concrete. By producing a
chair which has value carpentering is value producing. The value of the chair is
not its use-value, that's what makes it special, different from houses and
wool. The value producing side of housebuilding does not consist in connecting
bricks by cement. The value-forming side of carpentering, housebuilding, cheese
making is that labour was performed.

Of course, human labour-power is always expended with a certain form, as such
without form it does not exist. Nobody does abstract human labour as such, one
always performs "concrete labour". Furthermore, one could always take the
position to abstract away those concrete things (spinning, weaving, baking ...)
and call the result labour as such: purposeful interaction with nature
… that's how its talked about later. But that's not what is meant when we talk
about abstract labour.  The labour that counts because it produces value *is*
abstract labour.  In this society an abstraction which I could make in my head
is what becomes the yardstick to tell how much wealth e.g. shoes command. By
treating the products of labour as qualitatively equal the labours that produced
them are also treated equal. This abstract is not something we do as a part of
our scientific investigation, but something that the participants on the markets
do when they exchange. While this abstraction can in principle always be made
that this abstraction to pure expenditure becomes a relevant social property of
wealth is not a product of labour as such but of the particular social relations
in which it is performed. Put differently, it's not a quality of labour to
produce value but a quality of the market to reduce labour to homogeneous human
labour. That is, what is meant by "real abstraction".[^10]

Abstract human labour is a determination which asserts itself as purpose and
demand against concrete labour. When Marx talks about human labour “expended
without regard to the form of its expenditure” then the following is
addressed. When the purpose of production is the production of value (which is
the purpose of the commodity producer who has no interest in using the commodity
himself) then the branch of industry is irrelevant. Whether I am a carpenter, a
weaver, a builder, all the same, when it's about value. When I notice that some
branch of industry does not allow me to get hold of as much value as another, I
switch branches.  Hence, for example, farmers who stick to farming regardless of
how much it gains them in terms of value and insist on inheriting their land to
their children, don't quite fit in the capitalist mode of production.  The
value-forming labour is indifferent against the preferences for a particular
labour.

This attains a different harshness when one cannot switch branches. This could
be because one does know have the necessary skills or the necessary means of
production. The indifference towards the branch of industry as a determination
of value-forming labour asserts itself against the producer where she is
restricted to one branch. Where people insist on the particular branch or have
to insist on it, the producers perish of this demand.

It is not correct to say that a commodity has/is a use-value and has
exchange-value. Instead, a commodity is a use-value and is a value of which its
various exchange-values (one chair exchanges for $x$ beer, $y$ wines, $z$
cheeses, …) are only expressions.[^12] The third sub-chapter
of Chapter 1 will show that indeed for value to be properly expressed in needs
to appear as exchange-values.

We are talking about a process – labour – which produces a quantity –
value. Marx here measures this process in time – which certainly is one aspect
of it. Of course, one process can produce more of a certain substance in a given
time than another process. This is accounted for in a few paragraphs when Marx
discusses complicated vs. simple labour. This is also taken up again later:
intensity and time are two key aspects abstract labour. Normalising intensity –
i.e., treating more intense labour as equivalent to longer less intense labour –
we are left with the measure of time.

Value-producing labour is ruthless against the concrete side of labour.  A chair
producer who needs longer to produce a chair than the next guy does not produce
more value with one chair. On the contrary: the value of one chair is the same
as the value of another chair, regardless of who produced it and how she took to
do it. As values the chairs are treated equal and therefore the labour that
produced them is treated equal/equated. The labours that produce chairs are
compared on the market and equated. In retrospect this means that only that
chair-making time counts as value-producing which lives up to this comparison.

Abstract human labour as demand against concrete labour means that somebody who
for whatever reasons has physical or intellectual disadvantages is likely to
fail on the market. Socialisation, education etc. all have the same effect. That
labour which is less efficient because of it, compares less favourably on the
market. Put differently: this justice of the market means that those whose
physical or intellectual skills are less developed than for others are in a
worse position. The same is true for the means of production. The best physical
strength does not mean much if someone else can work twice as fast because of a
technological advantage. The question is then whether one can keep up through
sheer expenditure of body strength. However, this increased expenditure
definitely means the devastation of one's health, that's for sure.

There is a yardstick of value-producing labour which one has to live up to. How
does this yardstick come about? Through an average of what e.g.  chair producers
and market participants need to produce a chair. All of them together form this
standard every individual, concrete labour enters. On the other hand, every
concrete, individual labour time has to related to this standard and is measured
against it. This standard confronts each producers as an external fact against
which she is powerless. By doing so she contributes to this standard herself.

We need to differentiate between how much one contributes to the standard
though. If only one company owns a technology which allows them to produce much
faster than their competitors and hence produces 90% of all commodities sold on
the market then this individual contribution has the respective weight when
contributing to the average. If this company competes with 1000 independent
artisans who produce 10% of the commodities sold on the market, then their
individual performance only enters with about that weight.

Socially necessary labour on the one hand means that only that labour-time
counts as value-producing which is necessary on average to produce a commodity
not how much time was needed to produce it. On the other hand, this expresses
that too many commodities can be produced relative to effective demand. Socially
necessary has this side too which is discussed in Chapter 3.

If a producer Alice needs a ten hour working day to produce a chair, but on
average two chairs are produced in the same time, then Alice's chairs still have
the same value as all the other chairs. That the average counts as
value-producing, on the other hand, also applies to the fastest producer. If Bob
manages to produce four chairs per day, he produces twice as much value than the
average.

This means from a value perspective it makes sense to try harder, to improve
one's skills, to work more intensely and with a higher level of
productivity. Only, if everybody does that then the relative advantage is
gone. If all improve their performance per time then this new level is the
normal, necessary and average. They all wanted to achieve more value per time
with their performance but the end result is that they produce just as much
value as before the big push for more performance.  This will be taken up again
later in the part on “relative surplus value”.

That the determination of average labour performance asserts itself across
branches can be explained as follows. Let the average output of yoghurt producer
per day be 10 litres of yoghurt. Now, a chair producer, say, realises she could
produce 20 litres of yoghurt per working day.  She hence switches branches. This
pushes up the average in the production of yoghurt. Let's assume further her
market share is small and the average hence remains relatively low, i.e., the
increase is hardly noticeable and 10 litres of yoghurt have the same value as 2
chairs. Our skilled branch switcher hence produced twice as much value as before
when producing chairs. Other producers from other industries will notice this:
if they switch to yoghurt they can produce much more value in a day than if they
stick with chairs or whatever they are making. More and more will switch to
yoghurt and role up the market: the average increases. The eventual result will
be that 20 litres of yoghurt will be the average output of one day of yoghurt
production. Now, if the chair production did not change, 20 litres of yoghurt
are now worth as much as 2 chairs.

The indifference towards the particular branch of industry, which is in the
concept of abstract human labour, hence is presupposed here. Labour is thrown
where it is worthwhile. This way, the determination of socially necessary
labour-time asserts itself across branches.

The productivity of labour is a determination of concrete, useful labour. It
expresses the efficiency by stating how many goods can be produced per time. The
more skilful a labourer, the more intense she works the more goods she can
produce per hour. Using the right tools – means of production – one can increase
the productivity of labour enormously. Using a wedge can increase how much one
can lift, using a basket allows one to transport a lot more stuff than not using
one.  Nature too can play a decisive role. The same amount of labour may produce
a lot less potatoes given bad weather conditions than given good conditions. If
one is drilling for oil it makes a huge difference whether one hits it after 50m
or 1500m, the latter requires a lot more work.[^13]

Because productivity is a quality of concrete, useful labour it is not relevant
for value-producing or abstract labour. While an edge in productivity is
beneficial for a producer because her commodities are measured by the average,
this advantage is gone as soon as the competition catches up. More commodities
are produced per day but not more value than before. The value of a single
commodity decreases, because the measure of value is socially average labour.

From the standpoint of use-value and from the standpoint satisfaction of needs
and desires one can say: the faster a use-value can be produced the more goods
can be produced per day, the more people in need of that good can be provided
for. Or: if everybody is provided for we can work less if we are able to work
faster. Advances in productivity would enable more spare time.

From the standpoint of value this advance in productivity is of no benefit as
soon as it becomes the normal way of producing things. The mass of value that is
produced in a day simply remains the same. If value is concerned an increase in
productivity is no reason to work less. Spare time which one can enjoy is not
part of the programme of value. Value does not service the labourer, but the
labourer has to service value, has to act in accordance to its
demands.[^14]

So abstract labour isn't just another way of saying that people produce stuff
but a statement how they produce in this society or more precisely how they
confront each other in this society and what that means for the labour they
perform. Abstract labour is performed where commodities are produced. On the
other hand, abstract labour does not mean *nothing*, i.e., one could be tempted
to think that if abstract labour is something *specific* to this society it
would have nothing to do with labour as performed under all kinds of different
social conditions. According to this reading – perhaps aimed against a
naturalistic reading of abstract labour and value by Leninists and Social
Democrats – abstract labour has no physiological side to it, that would be a
naturalistic reading.  Hence, one doesn't know much more about value by reducing
it to abstract labour: one fairly empty social category is reduced to another. A
meaningless reduction, one could drop the mention of “labour” from “abstract
labour” and one is not any further in one's analysis than before the
reduction. Yet, it is one thing to explain that the physiological equality,
i.e., that people do stuff, does not constitute value, it is another thing to
claim value would have nothing to do with it. What is lost in this abstract
account are the results about what abstract labour as a social rule does to
concrete labour. That is, this way the critique of abstract labour is lost,
i.e., the account what it does to concrete labour and the immediate producers if
pure expenditure of labour-power, pure toil, something purely negative is what
counts.  Abstract labour asserts itself against the immediate producers because
it turns a physiological quality of their activity against them, reduces their
activity to it.[^15]

### Prices vs. value ###

Marx' comment that diamonds probably never have been paid for at their full
value, is quite confusing. After spending so much time on deriving value and
abstract labour as the substance of it, he comes out and says that commodities
do not necessarily fetch their value on the market. Put differently, the price
of a commodity (which will be discussed on sub-chapter) is not necessarily
quantitatively the same as its value. How this works precisely is answered only
in Capital, Volume 3. However, for most of what follows Marx makes the
simplifying assumption that things are bought and sold at their value.

> (Now we know the *substance* of value. It is *labour*. We know the *measure of
> its magnitude*. It is *labour-time*. The *form*, which stamps *value*as
> *exchange-value*, remains to be analysed. But before this we need to develop
> the characteristics we have already found somewhat more fully.)

This is a bit of a repetition, but one point should be emphasised here: labour
*is not* value.

David Harvey writes: “This allows him to formulate the crucial definition of
'value' as 'socially necessary labour-time;' which 'is the labour-time required
to produce any use-value under the conditions of production normal for a given
society and with the average degree of skill and intensity of labour prevalent
in that society:' He concludes, 'What exclusively determines the magnitude of
the value of any article is therefore the amount of labour socially necessary,
or the labour-time socially necessary for its production' (129). There is your
definition.”[^16]

This is not what Marx says nor is it correct. Socially necessary labour-time is
the *substance of commodity values* but it *is* not value. Value is the quality
of commodities to command social wealth or to have power of access to material
wealth. What gives them this quality is the socially necessary labour-time to
produce them, i.e., that it takes effort to produce them. This is pointed out
here because this identification of Harvey (and others) lends itself to missing
the point of this first sub-chapter: the crucial bit is not that value is
somehow related to labour but the social relations that arise when labour is
performed in private and related through exchange. Then the products of labour
become leverage against other producers and the labour needed to produce them
that what counts.

[^10]: “Labour seems a quite simple category. The conception of labour in this
    general form – as labour as such – is also immeasurably old. Nevertheless,
    when it is economically conceived in this simplicity, ‘labour’ is as modern
    a category as are the relations which create this simple
    abstraction.[…] [T]his abstraction of labour as such is not merely the
    mental product of a concrete totality of labours. Indifference towards
    specific labours corresponds to a form of society in which individuals can
    with ease transfer from one labour to another, and where the specific kind
    is a matter of chance for them, hence of indifference. Not only the
    category, labour, but labour in reality has here become the means of
    creating wealth in general, and has ceased to be organically linked with
    particular individuals in any specific form. Such a state of affairs is at
    its most developed in the most modern form of existence of bourgeois society
    – in the United States. Here, then, for the first time, the point of
    departure of modern economics, namely the abstraction of the category
    ‘labour’, ‘labour as such’, labour pure and simple, becomes true in
    practice. The simplest abstraction, then, which modern economics places at
    the head of its discussions, and which expresses an immeasurably ancient
    relation valid in all forms of society, nevertheless achieves practical
    truth as an abstraction only as a category of the most modern
    society. […] This example of labour shows strikingly how even the most
    abstract categories, despite their validity – precisely because of their
    abstractness – for all epochs, are nevertheless, in the specific character
    of this abstraction, themselves likewise a product of historic relations,
    and possess their full validity only for and within these relations.” (Karl

    amass, accumulate, pile.

[^12]: Hence, David Harvey's account of value – of which exchange-value is a
    form of appearance – is far off when he describes value as the unity of
    use-value and exchange-value: „Having begun with use-value and
    exchange-value-a dichotomy-he then arrives at a unitary concept of value
    ...“ (David Harvey – A Companion to Marx's Capital, p.32)

[^13]: The oil price is not fully determined by this. The switch of branch of
    industry discussed above which enforces the law of value for commodities is
    not necessarily possible: there are only a few regions in the world which
    have oil and hence simply throwing more labour at the problem is not
    necessarily possible for someone who does not access to these regions.

[^14]: “A commodity as a use-value has an eminently material function. Wheat
    for example is used as food. A machine replaces a certain amount of
    labour. This function, by virtue of which a commodity is a use-value, an
    article of consumption, may be called its service, the service it renders as
    a use-value. But the commodity as an exchange-value is always considered
    solely from the standpoint of the result. What matters is not the service it
    renders, but the service rendered to it in the course of its production.”
    (Karl Marx – A Contribution to the Critique of Political Economy)

[^15]: “The physiological equality of all labor is the material basis, the
    condition, for the social relation of abstract labor, but it is not that
    social relation itself. In other words, the fact that all labors are the
    expenditure of human labor makes it possible for society to treat all labors
    as equal, but is by itself not yet this equal treatment. This equal
    treatment is a social act.” (Hans G. Ehrbar – Annotations to Karl Marx'
