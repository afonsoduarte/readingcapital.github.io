> The wealth of societies in which the capitalist mode of production prevails
> appears as an ‘immense collection of commodities’;

In the first sentence Marx defines the object of analysis. He studies wealth as
it appears in capitalist societies. One might object that the wealth of
societies actually presents itself as the GDP or as debt or as money or …
However, here the starting point is much more simple: people need and want to
eat, shelter, tools to fix and produce stuff etc. – that is the material wealth
they need in any society. In this society, however, this material wealth appears
in commodity form and this particularity is the starting point of the
analysis. Hence, when Marx writes "appears" it expresses that the content
“wealth” appears in a specific mode: as the commodity.

To avoid anticipating the remainder of this chapter, we must for now rely on a
superficial dictionary style definition of what we mean when we say
“commodity”. In economics, in particular around the time when Marx was writing,
a commodity is something which is produced for sale or exchange.[^1]

This first definition of a commodity points to the attribute of the wealth under
consideration here that it needs to be produced. It consists of products of
labour. The things people consume must first be produced and somehow production
must be related to consumption: what is produced for whom, who produces it and
how. By definition this is a feature of any division of labour and cannot
change. What can change, though, is how this “coordination” is accomplished, the
social form. Or as Marx put it in response to his critics:

“Every child knows that any nation that stopped working, not for a year, but let
us say, just for a few weeks, would perish. And every child knows, too, that the
amounts of products corresponding to the differing amounts of needs demand
differing and quantitatively determined amounts of society’s aggregate
labour. It is self-evident that this necessity of the distribution of social
labour in specific proportions is certainly not abolished by the specific form
of social production; it can only change its form of manifestation. Natural laws
cannot be abolished at all. The only thing that can change, under historically
differing conditions, is the form in which those laws assert themselves.”[^2]

How these laws assert themselves and what additional laws assert themselves if
the wealth of societies appears in commodity form is the subject of
investigation.

Marx’s starting point is rather different from modern economics. The starting
point of modern economics is management of scarce resources in general:
“Economics … studies the behavior of individuals, households, and organizations
…, when they manage or use scarce resources, which have alternative uses, to
achieve desired ends.”[^3]

1. Marx’s starting point is an immense collection of *wealth* not scarcity.  The
   fundamental claim of current modern — i.e. neoclassical – economics is
   scarcity. What does scarcity — "there is not enough" — mean?  For example,
   say there is not enough coffee at some seminar for all to drink enough coffee
   to stay awake. Scarcity is a relation of how much stuff there is vs. how much
   someone wants for some purpose; scarcity is a category of a relation between
   stuff and need. Scarcity always relates something to a need or desire for
   it. It does not make sense to say there is not enough coffee, but we have to
   say "not enough for what?"  Yet, in modern economics stuff is defined as
   scarce regardless of the need that confronts it. Consequently, when these
   economists start with scarcity they do not consider the actual shortcomings
   around them or even rack their brains how to overcome them, e.g. “there
   aren't enough iPods so we can all listen to Sting at the same time, how do we
   make more?”  Instead, they simply require and posit scarcity as such as the
   first category of their economics. Because of this notion of scarcity, they
   also completely disregard production to make their case. Of course, there are
   things of which there is only a limited supply. But of many things more can
   be produced and this fact is disregarded in modern economics when scarcity as
   such is assumed. For example, Thomas Sowell explains scarcity using
   beach-front homes, i.e. something which is thought of as limited by its
   location, i.e. it is thought that you cannot make more.  Another common
   example is that in a dessert a glass of water would be a lot more valuable
   than in modern London. In a desert somebody would give everything for a glass
   of water because it is so scarce, you cannot make more. However, the object
   of investigation is the capitalist mode of production with its "immense
   collection of commodities" on the market and not a single exchange relation
   in a dessert where there is no market and no production for the market.
   Under capitalism no need is not fulfilled just because something is scarce
   per se. If I own enough to exchange I can fly to space or own as many beach
   front homes and glasses of water as I want. Modern economics investigates and
   advertises a particular way of organising production and consumption –
   i.e. the capitalist mode of production – and starts off with disregarding
   production to introduce its first premise: scarcity.

2. Marx’s starting point is the particularity of the capitalist mode
   production. The commodity form is a *particular* form in which wealth appears
   and is to be investigated as such: what is the commodity? Modern economics,
   on the other hand, claims to not to be specific to this society.  It claims
   to study the use of scarce resources in general and posits that the market is
   the most efficient mechanism for dealing with scarcity. They do not
   investigate the particular social form that they deal with but posit from the
   beginning that it is best; they do not study what actually exists but start
   from a positive verdict which they want to justify.  Therewith, these authors
   miss the observation with which Marx starts.

> the individual commodity appears as its elementary form. Our investigation
> therefore begins with the analysis of the commodity.

The appearance of material wealth in commodity form is the starting point of the
analysis, not its end.[^17] With the observation that wealth takes a particular
form, we are not done, we are just getting started. Marx's project is to start
from a simple observation and to proceed to the explanation. Marx attempts a
systematic development — from elementary to developed — of political economy in
capitalism, not just a list of observations.

We should take this project seriously and ask ourselves in every step how (if at
all) it followed from the last and should avoid the temptation to use results
that we anticipate later in the book to account for a claim made in the
beginning. The arguments developed later presuppose the elementary categories
and arguments developed in the beginning and cannot be used to explain those
elementary arguments in retrospect.

> The commodity is, at first,[^4] an external object, a thing which through
> its qualities satisfies human needs of whatever kind.

Following his predecessors[^5] Marx here clarifies that he means *material
wealth* when he speaks of wealth. He speaks of *objects* that are useful to us.

There are other things that might come to mind when we think of wealth in
general which do not seem to be covered by this definition: "services". Does a
haircut belong here? How about a train ride from London to Glasgow? How about a
conversation? These examples are not discussed here.  For now, we should think
of material objects when Marx talks of the wealth which takes commodity
form. Perhaps it is helpful to realise that all these "services" rely on
material objects themselves to be performed (scissors, trains, …).

It is useful to think about "services" in order gain some clarity what the
object under consideration is. It is also useful to distinguish why these
"services" do not fall under consideration here. The "service" haircut produces
a material result, but maybe not an external object. The "service" legal
counselling does not produce such an immediate material result. Marx's
restriction to material objects should be noted and how these different
"services" fit into what is being discussed here is a discussion that can and
should be had at a later point of the investigation. However, one cannot reject
this restriction on the grounds that one can think of other aspects, such as
"services", not being covered.

With "first of all" is expressed that what follows is not the final word on the
commodity. At this stage of the argument we may think of the commodity simply as
material wealth, i.e. we may ignore its specific social form as a commodity: it
is produced for exchange.  This form will be considered in a few paragraphs, but
whatever the social form is, it does not mean it is not material wealth.

> The nature of these needs, whether they arise, for example, from the stomach,
> or the imagination, makes no difference.

Marx states that it does not matter why someone wants something.  Important is –
for now – only that she wants that thing. He does not make this claim to express
a personal preference, taking a position on whether there should be "essential"
desires and "artificial" ones. This distinction which many people think about
when they think about needs and desires is not what Marx comments on
here. Instead, he is concerned with understanding the capitalist mode of
production. He observes that on the market it does not make a difference why
someone wants a particular commodity. The statement is a scientific statement,
not a judgement how something should be.

This indifference towards why someone wants something requires that a certain
level of abundance must have been achieved. If the production of food is the
foremost question since people just about manage to produce enough in order not
to starve being subject to somebody's whim would not be the way in which
production, distribution and consumption of food would be organised for
long. For example, assume that in a given society producers just about manage to
produce enough wheat to feed producers for the next year so they can produce
wheat and other useful objects for the year after. In this society using wheat
to build a flour pool in analogy to Scrooge McDuck's money pool would undermine
the reproduction of the whole society, it would cease to exist.  The societies
under consideration here are not dominated by nature imposed scarcity but there
is freedom to decide what wealth to produce for what purpose.

> Nor does it matter here how the thing satisfies man's need, whether directly
> as a means of subsistence, i.e. an object of consumption, or indirectly as a
> means of production.

Useful objects can be used in individual consumption where they are consumed and
that's it. They can also be used in productive consumption where they are used
as means to produce other useful objects. For example, wood is chopped and
either used to heat a home or used to make a chair. So this "coordination" of
production and consumption does not only relate production to consumption in the
sense that stuff that is consumed must be produced. It also relates production
to its own means: for production the means of production must be produced first.

> Every useful thing, for example, iron, paper, etc., may be looked at from the
> two points of view of quality and quantity.

A particular thing satisfies a particular need, not any need. If I’m hungry I
want ice cream not chairs. From this perspective things are very much not
interchangeable, they are of different qualities. When Marx writes "quality" he
does not mean "good" and "bad quality", but quality as in particular properties.

Also, I do not want ice cream as such but some quantity of ice cream. These
statements will be explained more below.

> Every useful thing is a whole composed of many properties; it can therefore be
> useful in various ways. The discovery of these ways and hence of the manifold
> uses of things is the work of history.

“Usefulness” is an expression of a relation between someone’s desire or need and
the physical properties of some external object. Discovering applications for
things is a historical process. For example this means discovering that magnets
can be used to point north. But this also means to discover that wood can be
turned into paper which then satisfies an entirely different need than wood. By
"work of history" is expressed that this knowledge must be acquired once and can
then be passed on to others, who do not have to rediscover it independently for
themselves.

We count things in particular ways according to their qualities.  For example,
we usually do not count chairs in weight but simply number them when we are
concerned with their usefulness for sitting on them. We count flour in weight,
we might count water sometimes in weight and sometimes in volume, depending on
how we look at it. Sometimes the choice of quantifying in volume instead of
weight comes down to convention. Always down to convention is how we express
length, weight etc. If we use the metric system or imperial is a question of
convention.

Overall, we do not say 12 water but 12 litres or 12 kilograms of water, but we
do say 12 chairs, because chairs are of such a quality that this makes
sense. Even how we quantify different things (chairs, wheat) differs between
them (weight, lengths, counting, volume).

A thing is useful because of its physical properties: the relation between me
and the thing requires specific properties in the thing. Things must be organic
to be edible for example.  It might be a human activity that discovers that
certain mushrooms are edible but it is their physical properties which allows to
discover this. Mushrooms have the capacity to be edible because of their
particular physical, chemical, etc. properties. All possible uses have the
physical properties in common: "One and the same use-value can be used in
various ways. But the extent of its possible application is limited by its
existence as an object with distinct properties."[^19] Usefulness is grounded in
particular qualities of a thing and these qualities make it a useful thing.[^6]
Marx here defines "useful thing" and "use-value" as synonyms.

> This property of a commodity is independent of the amount of labour required
> to appropriate its useful qualities.

Earlier we determined material wealth as useful objects which are produced,
i.e. products of labour. However, considered purely as a useful object the
amount of labour required to produce them is irrelevant. A piece of wood I found
on the street is as useful as a piece of wood for which I had to chop a
tree. When we find faster ways of producing coats, we can produce more coats in
the same time. Yet, a coat still keeps you warm the same. Use-value is a
category of consumption, not of production.

> When examining use-values, we always assume we are dealing with definite
> quantities, such as dozens of watches, yards of linen, or tons of iron.

To realise the qualities of use-values a certain quantity is necessary and
sufficient: With one grain of wheat I cannot eat my fill. For a two person
household usually one fridge is sufficient, four are usually too many for this
purpose. To make use of a certain quality it needs to be available in a certain
quantity. One brick is not enough to build a house, 1 billion is too much. One
grain of rice is too little for a meal, 100g perhaps about adequate. Put
differently, to build a house one does not want bricks, many bricks or more
bricks. One wants however many bricks it takes to build a house: definitely a
definite quantity.

Even if we do not know much many bricks it takes to build a house or how much
pasta it takes to fill us up, the actual task itself determines this
quantity. Our ignorance does not change this.

> The use-values of commodities provide the material for a special branch of
> knowledge, namely the commercial knowledge of commodities.

Studying all the various use-values is of practical importance, even
economically. However, this is a separate body of knowledge from understanding
the commodity.

> Use-values are only realized in use or in consumption.

Use-values realise their potential to satisfy human needs when they are
consumed. The realisation of use-values also extinguishes them. This is palpable
when we consider things like food or petrol, which are immediately extinguished
when we consume them. Other objects are not immediately extinguished when we
consume them, but they wear out more slowly, they die a slow death so to
speak. Hence, there is a continuous need to produce and reproduce commodities
under all social organisations of production and consumption.[^23]

> They constitute the material content of wealth, whatever its social form may
> be.  In the form of society to be considered here they are also the material
> bearers of … exchange-value.

Recall that in the first sentence the object was defined as the particular form
of wealth as it appears in capitalist societies. We then moved on to studying
the content of this wealth, the commodity's body considered as a useful
object. But it is their commodity form which is specific to the capitalist mode
of production. Consequently, the use-value side or usefulness is not how to
proceed. While use-values will play a role later during the investigation, we
cannot derive the particularity of the commodity from use-value. Material wealth
consists of useful objects without appearing in commodity form.

In all societies people need to eat and in all possible social organisations
people need to work to produce the stuff to consume. This cannot change, as
pointed out above. What can change, however, is the social form in which
consumption is related to production. One such form is the market which makes
exchange-value a particular social quality of wealth in societies where the
capitalist mode of production prevails.

> Exchange-value appears first of all as the quantitative relation, the
> proportion, in which use-values of one kind exchange for use-values of another
> kind.

For now, exchange-value appears as a relation between two use-values. If one can
get two chairs for one ton of apples, then two chairs are the exchange-value of
one ton of apples. By "one kind" is expressed that the next ton of apples also
gets two chairs — if the apples are of the same kind. Exchange-value is not a
property of a particular batch of apples, but every ton of apples has this
property.

With "relation" is expressed that not only one ton gives access to 2 chairs but
that e.g. two tons grant access to four chairs. Exchangeability is not bound to
one ton. This might seem trivial and self-evident but it is not: one could say,
for example, we want everybody to be able to get chairs, so as you buy more and
more chairs they become more and more expensive (measured in apples) or,
alternatively, one cannot even buy more than two chairs, full stop. But this is
clearly not how this society exchanges. From this we might conclude that in this
society it is a quality of apples to be exchangeable for chairs.

If one takes this standpoint and considers exchange-value as a property of the
commodity (an assumption which will be corrected in the following) then apples
are determined "exchangeable for chairs" which we might also express as "means to
access chairs" or "chair access resources". While the use-value of apples is
their quality to satisfy hunger and appetite, exchange-value — as far as we have
determined it so far – as a property of apples means one can get access to
chairs with them.

> This relation changes constantly with time and place. Hence exchange-value
> that is inseparably connected with the commodity, inherent in it, seems a
> contradiction in terms.

A year ago one ton of apples might have allowed to get three chairs. In
Birmingham this might still be the case, while in London one only gets two. In
one street apples might exchange for different quantities of chairs. Perhaps
even the same apple owner negotiates different "chair prices" for her apples
with different people. In light of these variations one could, when asking how
come that apples have the power to access chairs, conclude that this was indeed
not a potential of the apples. One could say as Butler in footnote 7: "The value
of a thing Is just as much as it will bring." This way, the explanation of
commodities as means of exchange would cease before it really started: all
random. Or one says that it is not random but essentially determined by the
appreciation of the persons involved in the trade. Then exchange-value would
depend on the various needs and desires of people and it would be wrong to say
that every apple has the same exchange-value. One would have to say: every apple
has all kinds of different exchange-values, depending on who has the apple. One
also could not talk about relations: if one ton of apples fetches two chairs,
this would not mean that two tons result in four chairs. To claim that the
exchange-value was grounded in the apple being an apple independent of the
subjective appreciation by the exchangers, that would be the position of an
"objective theory of value". The other standpoint would be that of the
"subjective theory of value", which makes up the modern mainstream in
economics. It considers the objective theory of value to be absurd by the
arguments listed above. However, these arguments deserve scrutiny:

A commodity does not only exchange for one particular other commodity, but for
many. That means it does not only have one exchange-value but many, in various
relations. The apple is not only a “chair access resource” or is not only “means
of access to chairs” but also a "boot-polish access resource", a "silk access
resource" etc. "Many exchange values" here means: apples are access resources to
any other use-value in this society which is available on the market.

This “content distinguishable from it” that all these exchange-values express is
a somewhat quantified "exchangeability as such" as a property of the
apple. Apple owners can access all material wealth that is available as a
commodity in this society.  How far this access reaches is only a question of
how many apples they have. Apples have the characteristic that they are access
resources to social wealth in a capitalist economy, where social wealth means
material wealth that is available in society, i.e. on the market.  That one can
use apples to access chairs is then only an expression of the more general
quality of apples to access anything. Apples do not have chairs as
exchange-value because apples are access resources to chairs, but because they
are *means of access sans phrase*. All those different exchange-values express
this same quality of the apple *about the apple*.

On the other hand, the "valid exchange-values of a particular commodity express
something equal" namely that for apples they all count as representatives of
social wealth.  Considered as exchange-values all commodities only count as
particular instances of social wealth as such, they are all the same. This is a
statement about all exchange-values of the apple, *about boot-polish, silk, gold
etc.*

An analogy: say Elizabeth is in a position of authority towards Alice.  We could
say that this is due to the special relation between Elizabeth and Alice or by
chance. However, let's say Elizabeth is also in a position of authority towards
Bob, Charley, Eve. In fact, let's assume Elizabeth is in a position of
authority towards everybody else. Each of these particular relations of command
and servitude are merely particular modes of expression of Elizabeth's power to
rule. At the same time Alice, Bob, Charley, Eve, etc. are all mutually
replaceable, they are all Elizabeth's subjects and count as particular
expressions of this.

Relative to those arguments above against the objective theory of value, we
hence have to say: while the definite proportions and quantities might change,
what remains is the quality of apples to access chairs. Furthermore, the
relations between apples and other commodities might change as well, but what
remains is the quality of apples to be exchangeable for them.  Quantitatively a
lot might change, but the quality of the apple to be exchangeable for, to grant
access to, any part of social wealth — given enough apples — remains. What gives
apples this power?

If a ton of apples gives access to two chairs, then it is also true that two
chairs allow one to get one ton of apples, this is just the perspective
reversed.  All the arguments in the last paragraph also apply to chairs. Chairs
are not only exchangeable for apples, because they are apple access resources
but because they generally have the quality of quantified exchangeability.
Chairs, too, represent means of access to the wealth in this society.

This is where the analogy from the last paragraph stops working. In that analogy
Elizabeth was not Alice's ruler because she was Alice's equal, on the contrary.
In contrast to this, commodities are not in a one-directional relationship of
access but relate to each other as *equal*. Chairs access apples because apples
access chairs, and vice versa.

In exchange the chair recognises our apples as a bit of social wealth, too.
This answers the question of what gives our apples the power to be exchangeable
for any other bit of social wealth: they are a bit of social wealth themselves.
Apples are means of access to a bit social wealth because they *are*. Commodity
exchange means that any particular bit of social wealth counts as a greater or
lesser quantity of social wealth as such.

The third thing which is neither apples nor chairs, but contained in both of
them is that they are quantities of social wealth sans phrase. What is this
social wealth in general?

Determined as social wealth as such the particular qualities of commodities as
apples, chairs, iron, corn do not matter, given the right quantity they are all
the same. Exchange-value is not only a disregard of a particular quality of
commodities, exchange-value expresses the disregard of any quality of the
use-value: "precisely by its abstraction". The only difference they are capable
of as social wealth as such is that of magnitude. The key point is not that they
might differ in quantity, but that they *cannot* differ in quality.

We are looking for a common basis which characterises a commodity as social
wealth as such which in turn grounds its capacity to access social wealth in the
hands of others. From this it should be clear that our search for the "third
thing" is not one of the kind: what kind of things can I think of that they
might have in common. If that was the case, we could arrive at the conclusion
that all things have a mass or have something to do with particles or
so. Conclusions we could then try to disprove by finding counter examples. Yet,
this does not explain their quality "to give access to social wealth because
they are", these commonalities, if they exist, do not explain what goes on when
a society exchanges its products of labour and therewith equates them.

Every commodity needs a use-value. Only when there is need in society for a
thing, it may be used to attract the interest if other members of
society. However, the usefulness of a thing cannot be quantified. If I want to
sit down on a table with five people then I need a table and five chairs. Four
chairs do not satisfy this need, six chairs do not offer more usefulness for
this purpose than five. The standpoint "at least I have three chairs, then only
two people need to sit on the floor" is an expression of managing scarcity and
not an expression that five chairs satisfy a need better than three. Five
satisfy my need, three don't. More generally, if we compare the usefulness of
different use-values then the statement that a bicycle would be more useful than
lunch is pretty absurd. If I am hungry a bicycle does not help, if I want to get
from A to B lunch is of no help.

However, for many people these alternatives, comparisons and quantifications
appear as rather straight-forward. They think about their day-to-day life and
there such questions appear quite often … due to limited spending power: "Do I
treat myself to a good meal and don't go to the pub or vice versa?" However,
when asking this question we already compares the amount of our money with the
price of the two things we would enjoy doing. We come to the conclusion that
these magnitudes do not match up and hence we have to limit ourselves. Only
after we compared the respective magnitudes we arrive at limiting our needs and
desires. Only after this step we make the absurd but forced upon ourselves
comparison: what can I do without. This way the daily struggle appears as if the
exchange relations were determined by use-values or our own individual needs and
desires.

Two comparisons between use-values are sensible, but have nothing to do with the
question considered here: Firstly, I can compare a use-value in relation to a
particular need. If I want to drink a hot drink, a cup might be more useful than
a glass. A bicycle, however, certainly does not come to mind. Secondly, I can
ask myself whether remodelling my room is worth the effort if it takes up so
much time and energy that afterwards I do not have time to enjoy my remodelled
room. The effort puts the benefit so much into question that I rather not have
the benefit. This relates effort to benefit for a particular useful thing, but
certainly does not relate different useful things.

From the perspective of the commodity seller, usefulness is definitely not what
founds exchangeability. She does not want to use the commodity but exchange
it. For her it does not have any usefulness at all. The owners of the BMW
company may want drive, say, 10 cars themselves, the remain thousands of cars
which are produced every day are certainly not useful to them. For those who
want to have one of those BMWs it too cannot be irrelevant how many apples they
have to give up in exchange for it. One could say, well those apples do not have
use-value for them, so it does not matter how many they have to give up, they
gets what they really want. Because access to use-values in this society is
dependent on how much I own, use-value only plays the part that it must exist in
exchange; the exchangers confront each other on the exchange-value side. Because
everybody does it, an individual decision also does not play a big role. I have
to take other exchange relations into account and take part. By taking part I
contribute myself that others too cannot act accordingly to their individual
preferences.

Finally, that the particular use-values are not the point when we are
considering the exchange-value side of commodities is illustrated by the fact
that any use-value — if there is demand for it in society — enables one to
exchange it for all other things in society if I own them. Producing gold,
fertilisers or toilets, all these things do not differ qualitatively as to what
wealth I can get access to. If I have enough, I can exchange them for what I
need and desire, because they are recognised as social wealth themselves.

> If then we disregard the use-value of commodities, only one property remains,
> that of being products of labour.

We are searching for an answer to the question what it means to speak of social
wealth as such in disregard of its particular qualities as particular useful
objects. What does it mean to speak of an apple as a bit of social wealth as
such, in abstraction from its apple-ness as a foundation for the apple's
capacity to access any social wealth?

It is clear that material wealth must be produced, it does not fall from the sky
but requires effort.  It is also clear — cf. Marx' letter to Kugelmann above —
that under any mode of production somehow society's labour must be directed,
production and consumption "coordinated". However, in the societies "where the
capitalist mode of production prevails" not much coordination is actually going
on.  Producers produce in private, without a common plan. Instead, they produce
for exchange and only on the market they find out if their products can be
exchanged for those products which they need. On the market they find out if the
product of their efforts is recognised as social wealth, if their labour was in
vain or not. The form in which production and consumption are coordinated is
that the products of labour all count as a bit of social wealth as such if they
are successfully exchanged. In a commodity producing and exchanging society the
fact that it requires effort to produce material wealth is used to make the
other exchanging party hand over its bit of social wealth in return. This is
what we mean when we say that commodities recognise each other as social wealth.

There are many things which are not products of labour which still can be
exchanged. What about those? Virgin soil for example. Marx deals with virgin
soil and how its value is determined in Volume 3. For now, we can say: for the
things we need to live, things which require no labour at all, are the
exception.[^8] Marx will pick this up again briefly at the end of this
sub-chapter.

Now we arrived at the conclusion that social wealth as such is somehow related
to labour. How?

By producing a chair, a use-value, carpentering is concrete. By producing a
chair which has exchange-value carpentering produces social wealth as such. The
chair as social wealth as such is not the chair as the use-value, that's what
makes it special, different from houses and wool. The social-wealth-as-such
producing side of house-building does not consist in connecting bricks by
cement. The social-wealth-as-such forming side of carpentering, house-building,
cheese making is that labour as such was performed.

When producers produce commodities they not only produce particular useful
things but also each a bit of social wealth as such. All their labour together
in the world of commodities counts as one and the same mass of labour of which
each of them produced a part as a particular commodity.

Of course, human labour-power is always expended with a certain form, as such
without form it does not exist. Nobody performs abstract human labour as such,
one always performs "concrete labour". Furthermore, one could always take the
position to abstract away the concrete sides of spinning, weaving, baking … when
considering them and call the result labour as such: purposeful interaction with
nature … that is how its talked about later. But that's not what is meant when
we say abstract labour.

The labour that produces social wealth as such is abstract labour. In this
society an abstraction which I could make in my head is what becomes the
standard which characterise my product as wealth. By treating the products of
labour as qualitatively equal the labours that produced them are also treated
equal. This abstraction is not something we do as a part of our scientific
investigation, but something that the participants on the markets do when they
exchange. While this abstraction can in principle always be made it is not a
product of labour in itself that this abstraction to pure expenditure becomes
the relevant social property of wealth as such; instead, this requires
particular social relations in which labour is performed. Put differently, it's
not a quality of labour to produce value but a quality of the market to reduce
labour to homogeneous human labour.[^10] The physiological equality of all
labour, that there actually is a commonality in labour, is the material basis,
the condition, for the social relation of abstract labour, but it is not that
social relation itself. The fact that all labours are the expenditure of human
labour makes it possible for society to treat all labours as equal, but is by
itself not yet this equal treatment.[^20]

After having discussed social wealth as such for a few paragraphs Marx finally
gives it a name: value.

When Marx talks about human labour "expended without regard to the form of its
expenditure" then the following is addressed. When the purpose of production is
the production of value (which is the purpose of the commodity producer who has
no interest in using the commodity himself) then the branch of industry is
irrelevant. Whether I am a carpenter, a weaver or a builder is all the same,
when the purpose of production is to produce value. When I notice that some
branch of industry does not allow me to get hold of as much value as another, I
switch branches. Hence, for example, farmers who stick to farming regardless of
how much it gains them in terms of value and insist on passing their land to
their children, don't quite fit in the capitalist mode of
production. Value-forming labour is indifferent against the preferences for a
particular labour (whatever the reason for this preference).

This attains a different harshness when one cannot switch branches. This could
be because one does know have the necessary skills or the necessary means of
production. The indifference towards the branch of industry as a determination
of value-forming labour asserts itself against the producer where she is
restricted to one branch. Where people insist on the particular branch or have
to stick to it, the producers perish of this demand.  Abstract human labour is a
determination which asserts itself as purpose and demand against concrete
labour.

It is not correct to say that a commodity is a use-value and an exchange-value
or even to say it has one exchange-value. Instead, a commodity is a use-value
and is a value of which its various exchange-values (one chair exchanges for $x$
beer, $y$ wines, $z$ cheeses, …) are only expressions.[^12]

If the substance of value is abstract human labour, its magnitude is amount of
abstract human labour. How do we measure such a magnitude?  Marx here measures
labour in time to arrive at an expression which quantifies it. Certainly, we can
say that working longer means more labour is expended, insofar is time a measure
of labour. However, two labour processes could take the same amount of time but
be of different intensity. One of them would expend more labour-power in the
same time as the other. In this case time would not actually be an adequate
measure of amount of labour. This is taken up again later in chapter 15:
intensity and time are the two measures of abstract labour.  For now,
normalising intensity – i.e., treating more intense labour as equivalent to
longer less intense labour – we are left with the measure of time.

A chair producer who needs longer to produce a chair than the next guy does not
produce more value with one chair. On the contrary: the value of one chair is
the same as the value of another chair, regardless of who produced it and how
long she took to do it. This points to the fact that chair maker competes
against chair-maker. As values the chairs are treated equal and therefore the
labour that produced them is treated equal and equated. In retrospect this means
that only that chair-making time counts as value-producing which lives up to
this comparison.

When a product of labour contains value and is exchanged on the market, this is
not a reward of some sort for labour performed. The actual labour expended on a
particular product is not what counts, but only how much time is socially
necessary. The commodity in one's hand functions as lever to gain access to
social wealth because it takes effort to produce it, not because one worked hard
to produce it. That's your problem.

If a producer Alice needs a ten hour working day to produce a chair, but on
average two chairs are produced in the same time, then Alice's chairs still have
the same value as all the other chairs. That the average counts as
value-producing, on the other hand, also applies to the fastest producer.  If
Bob manages to produce four chairs per day, he produces twice as much value than
the average.

This means from a value perspective it makes sense to try harder, to improve
one's skills, to work more intensely and with a higher level of productivity.
Only, if everybody does that then the relative advantage is gone.  If all
improve their performance per time then this new level is the normal, necessary
and average. They all wanted to achieve more value per time with their
performance but the end result is that they produce just as much value as before
the big push for more performance.  This will be taken up again later in the
part 4.

This also means that somebody who for whatever reasons has physical or
intellectual disadvantages is likely to fail on the market. Education,
socialisation etc. all have the same effect.  That labour which is less
efficient because of it, compares less favourably on the market.  Put
differently: this justice of the market means that those whose physical or
intellectual skills are less developed than for others are in a worse position.

The same is true for the means of production.  The best physical strength does
not mean much if someone else can work twice as fast because of a technological
advantage. The question is then whether one can keep up through sheer
expenditure of body strength.  However, this increased expenditure definitely
means the devastation of one's health, that's for sure.  Value-producing labour
is ruthless against the concrete side of labour.

There is a standard of value-producing labour which one has to live up to. How
does this standard come about? Through an average of what e.g. chair producers
producing for the market need to produce a chair. All of them together form this
standard. Every individual, concrete chair making labour enters. On the other
hand, every concrete, individual labour time has to related to this standard and
is measured against it. This standard confronts each producers as an external
fact against which she is powerless. By doing so she contributes to this
standard herself.

We need to differentiate between how much one contributes to the standard,
though. If only one company owns a technology which allows them to produce much
faster than their competitors and hence produces 90% of all commodities sold on
the market then this individual contribution has the respective weight when
contributing to the average. If this company competes with 1000 independent
artisans who produce 10% of the commodities sold on the market, then their
individual performance only enters with about that weight.

On the one hand, socially necessary labour means that only that labour-time
counts as value-producing which is necessary on average to produce a commodity
not how much time was needed to produce it. On the other hand, this expresses
that too many commodities can be produced relative to effective demand. This
side of socially necessary is discussed in chapter 3.

That the determination of average labour performance asserts itself across
branches can be explained as follows. Let the average output of yogurt producer
per day be 10 litres of yogurt. Now, a chair producer, say, realises she could
produce 20 litres of yogurt per working day. She hence switches branches. This
pushes up the average in the production of yogurt. Let’s assume further her
market share is small and the average hence remains relatively low, i.e., the
increase is hardly noticeable and 10 litres of yogurt have the same value as 2
chairs. Our skilled branch switcher hence produced twice as much value as before
when producing chairs. Other producers from other industries will notice this:
if they switch to yogurt they can produce much more value in a day than if they
stick with chairs or whatever they are making. More and more will switch to
yogurt and role up the market: the average increases. The eventual result will
be that 20 litres of yogurt will be the average output of one day of yogurt
production. Now, if the chair production did not change, 20 litres of yogurt
are now worth as much as 2 chairs.

The indifference towards the particular branch of industry, which is in the
concept of abstract human labour, hence is presupposed here. Labour is thrown
where it is worthwhile. This way, the determination of socially necessary
labour-time asserts itself across branches.

The productivity of labour is a determination of concrete, useful labour. It
expresses efficiency by stating how many goods can be produced per time. The
more skillful a labourer the more goods she can produce per hour. Using the right
tools – means of production – one can increase the productivity of labour
enormously. Using a wedge can increase how much one can lift, using a basket
allows one to transport a lot more stuff than not using one. Nature, too, can
play a decisive role. The same amount of labour may produce a lot less potatoes
given bad weather conditions than given good conditions. If one is drilling for
oil it makes a huge difference whether one hits it after 50m or 1500m, the
latter requires a lot more work.[^13]

Because productivity is a quality of concrete, useful labour it does not enter
the magnitude of value side. While an edge in productivity is beneficial for a
producer because her commodities are measured by the average, this advantage is
gone as soon as the competition catches up.  More commodities are produced per
day but not more value than before. The value of a single commodity decreases,
because the measure of value is socially necessary labour-time.

From the standpoint of use-value and from the standpoint satisfaction of needs
and desires one can say: the faster a use-value can be produced the more goods
can be produced per day, the more people in need of that good can be provided
for. Or: if everybody is provided for we can work less if we are able to work
faster. Advances in productivity would enable more spare time.

From the standpoint of value this advance in productivity is of no benefit as
soon as it becomes the normal way of producing things. The mass of value that is
produced in a day simply remains the same. If value is concerned an increase in
productivity is no reason to work less. Spare time which one can enjoy is not
part of the programme of value. Value does not service the labourer, but the
labourer has to service value, has to act in accordance to its demands.[^14]

So abstract labour as the substance of value and socially necessary labour-time
as the measure of value isn't just another way of saying that people produce
stuff. These are statements how they produce. More precisely how they confront
each other in this society and what that means for the labour they perform.
Abstract labour is performed where commodities are produced. On the other hand,
abstract labour does not mean nothing, i.e., one could be tempted to think that
if abstract labour is something specific to this society it would have nothing
to do with labour as performed under all kinds of different social conditions. A
reading, which is perhaps aimed against a reading of abstract labour by
Leninists who think of it as a condition of human existence, holds that abstract
labour has no physiological side to it, that would be a naturalistic
reading. Hence, one doesn't know much more about value by reducing it to
abstract labour: one fairly empty social category is reduced to another. A
meaningless reduction, one could drop the mention of “labour” from “abstract
labour” and one is not any further in one’s analysis than before the
reduction. Yet, it is one thing to explain that the physiological equality,
i.e., that people do stuff, does not constitute value, it is another thing to
claim value would have nothing to do with it. What is lost in this abstract
account are the results about what abstract labour as a social rule does to
concrete labour. That is, this way the critique of abstract labour is lost,
i.e., the account what it does to concrete labour and the immediate producers if
pure expenditure of labour-power, pure toil, something purely negative is what
counts. Abstract labour asserts itself against the immediate producers because
it turns a physiological quality of their activity against them, reduces their
activity to it.

Marx’ comment that diamonds probably never have been paid for at their full
value, is quite confusing. After spending so much time on deriving value and
abstract labour as the substance of it, he comes out and says that commodities
do not necessarily fetch their value on the market. Put differently, the price
of a commodity (which will be discussed on sub-chapter) is not necessarily
quantitatively the same as its value. How this works is only fully explained in
volume 3. However, for most of what follows Marx makes the simplifying
assumption that things are bought and sold at their value.

We have established that on the market the products of labour confront each
other as social wealth as such, they are reduced to the effort it takes to
produce them. This effort, which is stripped of its content, is measured in
time. But note that labour is not value.

David Harvey writes: “This allows him to formulate the crucial definition of
'value' as 'socially necessary labour-time;' which 'is the labour-time required
to produce any use-value under the conditions of production normal for a given
society and with the average degree of skill and intensity of labour prevalent
in that society:' He concludes, 'What exclusively determines the magnitude of
the value of any article is therefore the amount of labour socially necessary,
or the labour-time socially necessary for its production’ (129). There is your
definition.”[^16]

This is not what Marx says nor is it correct. Socially necessary labour-time is
the measure of the magnitude of value, it is neither its substance nor is it
value. Value is the quality of commodities to command social wealth because they
are. What gives them this quality is that it takes effort to produce
them. Socially necessary labour-time measures this effort.  This is pointed out
here because this identification of Harvey (and others) lends itself to missing
the point of this first sub-chapter: the crucial bit is not that value is
somehow related to labour but the social relations that arise when labour is
performed in private and related through exchange. Only then the products of
labour become leverage against other producers and the labour needed to produce
them becomes that what exclusively counts.[^22]

The condition for a product of labour to be a commodity and to be value is to be
useful to others, but not only useful to others in some way, but useful to
others who can and do recognise it as a bit social wealth as such in
exchange. Only products of private producers who produce for exchange confront
each other as value-determined commodities. Things which are not produced for
exchange do not have value and neither do things which are not products of labour
but are exchanged on the market.

    general form – as labour as such – is also immeasurably old. Nevertheless,
    when it is economically conceived in this simplicity, ‘labour’ is as modern
    a category as are the relations which create this simple abstraction.[…]
    [T]his abstraction of labour as such is not merely the mental product of a
    concrete totality of labours. Indifference towards specific labours
    corresponds to a form of society in which individuals can with ease transfer
    from one labour to another, and where the specific kind is a matter of
    chance for them, hence of indifference. Not only the category, labour, but
    labour in reality has here become the means of creating wealth in general,
    and has ceased to be organically linked with particular individuals in any
    specific form. Such a state of affairs is at its most developed in the most
    modern form of existence of bourgeois society – in the United States. Here,
    then, for the first time, the point of departure of modern economics, namely
    the abstraction of the category ‘labour’, ‘labour as such’, labour pure and
    simple, becomes true in practice. The simplest abstraction, then, which
    modern economics places at the head of its discussions, and which expresses
    an immeasurably ancient relation valid in all forms of society, nevertheless
    achieves practical truth as an abstraction only as a category of the most
    modern society. […] This example of labour shows strikingly how even the
    most abstract categories, despite their validity – precisely because of
    their abstractness – for all epochs, are nevertheless, in the specific
    character of this abstraction, themselves likewise a product of historic
    relations, and possess their full validity only for and within these

    earlier version of our own commentary) These comments miss the point of this
    paragraph: the distinction between the content material wealth and its
    commodity form.

[^23]: That some objects wear out even when we do not use them, is no counter
    argument to this claim. The claim is not that only consumption wears out
    objects, but that whatever else might cause it, consumption does so,
    too. That some objects wear out so slowly that we can pretty much ignore it
    from a practical standpoint also does not constitute a counter argument to
    the claim that continuous production and reproduction is necessary for a
    society to survive.
