## The Object of the Inquiry ##

The process of reproduction of capital includes (a) the immediate process of
production where it realises its determining motive of producing surplus-value.
It also includes (b) the circulation process - buying and selling
- which it has to go through to renew the process of production. At the same
time does capital need to go through the process of production in order to
re-enter the sphere of circulation.

The continued realisation of valorisation is conditioned on the continuous
change of form of capital from commodity to money to productive capital. In this
change of form each individual capital is dependent on all other capitals in
society. The other capitals must buy the commodities one capital has to sell and
sell means of production to it, otherwise there are frictions. Each individual
capital produces, buys and sell according to its own needs and motives, not as a
self-conscious part of total social capital. At the same time, each individual
capital only exists as a part of total social capital and is dependent on it.

The overall process of reproduction of capital involves both productive and
unproductive consumption. The reproduction of total social capital includes the
acts of exchange where workers are paid for their labour-power and where they
use this money to buy the products of sustenance they require. This process also
includes the transformation of surplus-value into luxury articles for the
capitalists. The totality of all individual capital's circuits hence not only
contain the circulation of capital but also commodity circulation in general.
Reproduction of workers and luxury consumption of capitalists are not acts of
reproduction to be considered separate from the reproduction of capital but are
part of the reproduction of capital as total social capital.

In Volume 1 we simply presupposed that capital sells all its commodities at
value and that it finds the material means for its production on the market. So
far in Volume 2 the process of circulation was considered. The result of this
investigation was that the success of capital presupposes the success of capital
elsewhere. The realisation of $C'$ presupposes the realisation of $C'$ elsewhere
(Chapter 3) and that the accumulation of capital presupposes the accumulation of
capital else (Chapter 17). In Parts I and II this relationship was pointed out,
but not developed or studied in its own right.

The object of Part 3 is then to study the interlink of individual capitals which
stamps them as independent parts of total social capital and the reproduction of
this total social capital.The content this reproduction is the reproduction of
the material means for the production of surplus-value. The form of this
process, how it is accomplished, is the circulation process, where individual
capitals interact and form total social capital.

### Equilibrium and Friction ###

In Volume 1 we learned that the laws of commodity circulation developed there
ought not to be confused with harmonic relations. Marx pointed to the
oppositions and frictions and made fun of the dogma which claims that commodity
circulation would produce an equilibrium of sales and purchases. He showed
abstractly how the pursuit of money making by all undermines the conditions of
this pursuit, which eventually leads to a breakdown: crisis.

The same needs to be considered now when the reproduction of total social
capital is considered. The purpose of individual capitals is only realised if an
individual capital fits into the overall process of reproduction of total social
capital. This does not mean, however, that the success of the overall
reproduction process is its purpose. This also does not mean that the invisible
hand of the market takes care of this fitting. The capitalist mode of production
is a system where the individual parts have opposing purposes and
interests. Hence, these parts change and adapt relatively to the overall system
or bring the overall process to stand-still: crisis.

## The Role of Money Capital ##

Individual capital steps on the stage in the form of money capital.  Money is
its prime mover as money capital. All means of production and all labour-power
must first be bought with money. This is still true for social capital and no
new question arises. However, the scale of capitalist production - as already
shown in Volume 1 - does not have an absolute limit in the amount of money
capital in operation (increases in productivity, economy in the use of fixed
capital, â€¦). Also, increasing the turnover allows a bigger productive capital to
be set in motion with the same money capital. Already for individual capital is
money not a strict barrier to its reproduction and accumulation.

On the other hand, money capital must exist alongside productive capital. Some
money capital must lay idle. This money must be produced and renewed by society
which reduces the amount of labour available to society for the production of
surplus-value. However, insofar this money already exists no problem appears
(except for wear and tear) when dealing with the reproduction of total social
capital. The amount of idle money which must exist alongside productive capital
is dependent on the turnover of capital. Insofar as the turnover is determined
by the length of the working period, it is conditioned by the material
conditions of production not by the specific social character of capitalist
production. Under all modes of production society would have to deal with some
branches of industry taking a long time to finish their products. The workers
involved in those branches would withdraw means of subsistence from society's
pool of products, but they would not contribute products of their own for a long
time. However, in the capitalist mode of production this takes the form that
branches with a long turnover throw money into circulation for a long time,
without throwing an equivalent in value as commodities. For the same reason, the
reproduction of total social capital is conditioned on individual capitals'
circuits interlocking correctly, not on the amount of money capital available.

The question "where does the money come from" is not a central question for the
following investigation.  If individual capitals do not inerlock without
friction, this might express itself as a lack of money, but this is a symptom
not a cause.
