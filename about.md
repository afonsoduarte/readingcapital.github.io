This site collects various summarise, notes, comments, reading aids etc. on
Capital by Karl Marx. Page numbers refer to the Penguin Classics editions. The
notation "X:Y" means the Y-th full paragraph from page X. This implies that the
quote might be on a page with number larger than X if a paragraph spans more
than a page.

These notes are far from complete, especially Volume 2 and 3 are very sparse at
the moment. New material is added when it is ready.

Critique, correction and contributions are very welcome.

## Technical Details ##

This site is built from plain text files available on
[GitHub](https://github.com/readingcapital/readingcapital.github.io). These text
files are in markdown format, which can be easily translated into various other
formats such as HTML (this site), PDF, ODT and ePub.
[Pandoc](http://johnmacfarlane.net/pandoc/) does a good job.
